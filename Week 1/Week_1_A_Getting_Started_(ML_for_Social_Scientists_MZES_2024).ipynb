Other reasons for needing a local Python distribution are package versions, reproducibility, and easier access to GPUs to do resource-intensive work. Unlike R, in Python, you should carefully assign package versions when installing them. Otherwise, you might end up with version clashes between several package dependencies. Beyond that, working with an isolated environment per project in Python is very common. This means you install packages in a so-called *Virtual Environment* or *Conda Environment*. Environments do not only help you in keeping track of packages but also ensure the reproducibility of your findings on other machines."
